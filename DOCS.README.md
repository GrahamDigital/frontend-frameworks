# Welcome

## About this project

This is the home of our Javascript libraries. These libraries can be used to render the
Cloudinary images generated by @cloudinary/base.
<br />

Our library includes advanced functionality that adds additional features and capabilities to the 
default image component. 
                                                 

The following are the available plugins-

- accessibility.
- lazyload.
- placeholder.  
- responsive.

To learn more about our plugins, navigate to the plugins tab.

## Installation
To get started, install the npm client package of your choice along with our base package.
For example, to use Cloudinary in a React environment, the following packages should be installed.
   
```bash
npm install @cloudinary/base 
npm install @cloudinary/react
```

**Note**: To use Angular install `@cloudinary/angular` 

For more information on our supported frameworks, navigate to the frameworks tab.

## Simple usage
To following is a simple example using React, for more information on React and other 
frameworks, please navigate to the frameworks tabs. 
```tsx
// Import the cloudinary class, and the plugins you want to use
// In this case, we import a cloudinary image type and accessibility and responsive.

import React, { Component } from 'react'
import {CloudinaryImage} from "@cloudinary/base/assets/CloudinaryImage";
import { CldImg, accessibility, responsive } from '@cloudinary/react';

 const App = () => {
    let img = new CloudinaryImage('sample', { cloudName: 'demo'});
    return (
        <div>
            <CldImg transformation={img} plugins={[responsive(), accessibility()]}/>
        </div>
    )
  };
```

## Plugin Order

<div>
We recommended the following order when using our plugins to achieve the best results. 
<br/><br/>

```tsx
<CldImg plugins={[lazyload(),responsive(), accessibility(), placeholder()]}/>
```

You can omit any plugin, but the order from above should 
remain to ensure the best possible results.
