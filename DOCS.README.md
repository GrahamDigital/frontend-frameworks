# Welcome

## About this project

This is the home of our Javascript frontend SDKs.
<br />

- [@cloudinary/html](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cloudinary/html) - The HTML SDK used to render an html image
 element.
- [@cloudinary/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cloudinary/react) - The React SDK used to render an image
 component.
- [@cloudinary/angular](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cloudinary/angular) - The Angular SDK used to render an image
 component.

Moreover, these libraries can be used to render the
Cloudinary URLs generated by [@cloudinary/base](https://github.com/cloudinary/cloudinary-js-base).
<br />

The [Cloudinary base](https://github.com/cloudinary/cloudinary-js-base) project is used to generate urls for your 
media assets and their transformations on Cloudinary. 
<br />

To render these URLs you can use one of our frontend SDKs described above. We currently support [React](https://cloudinary.github.io/frontend-frameworks/public/docs/ReactSDK.html)
and [Angular](https://cloudinary.github.io/frontend-frameworks/public/docs/AngularSDK.html).
On top of displaying your images, our library includes advanced functionality that adds additional features
and capabilities. 
                                                 

To add this extra functionality, you can import one or all of the following plugins:

- [accessibility](https://cloudinary.github.io/frontend-frameworks/public/docs/accessibility.html) - Used to make your images more accessible to your users with visual disabilities. 

- [lazyload](https://cloudinary.github.io/frontend-frameworks/public/docs/lazyload.html) - Used to delay loading images if they are not yet visible on the screen.

- [placeholder](https://cloudinary.github.io/frontend-frameworks/public/docs/placeholder.html) - Used to display a lightweight version of an image while the target image is downloading.

- [responsive](https://cloudinary.github.io/frontend-frameworks/public/docs/responsive.html) - Used to resize your images automatically based on the viewport size.


## Installation
To get started, install the npm client package of your choice along with our base package.
For example, to use Cloudinary in a [React](https://cloudinary.github.io/frontend-frameworks/public/docs/ReactSDK.html) environment, the following packages should be installed:
   
```bash
npm i @cloudinary/react @cloudinary/base
```

**Note**: To use [Angular](https://cloudinary.github.io/frontend-frameworks/public/docs/AngularSDK.html) install `@cloudinary/angular` 

For more information on our supported frameworks, navigate to the frameworks tab.

## Simple usage
The following is a simple example using [React](https://cloudinary.github.io/frontend-frameworks/public/docs/ReactSDK.html).
For more information on React and other frameworks, navigate to the frameworks tab. 
```tsx
// Import the cloudinary class, and the plugins you want to use
// In this case, we import a Cloudinary image type and accessibility and responsive.

import React, { Component } from 'react'
import {CloudinaryImage} from "@cloudinary/base/assets/CloudinaryImage";
import { CldImg, accessibility, responsive } from '@cloudinary/react';

 const App = () => {
    let img = new CloudinaryImage('sample', { cloudName: 'demo'});
    return (
        <div>
            <CldImg transformation={img} plugins={[responsive(), accessibility()]}/>
        </div>
    )
  };
```

## Plugin Order

<div>
We recommended the following order when using our plugins to achieve the best results. 
<br/><br/>

```tsx
<CldImg plugins={[lazyload(),responsive(), accessibility(), placeholder()]}/>
```

You can omit any plugin, but the order from above should remain.
