# Welcome

## About this project

This is the home of our Javascript libraries. These libraries can be used to render the
Cloudinary URLs generated by [@cloudinary/base](https://github.com/cloudinary/cloudinary-js-base).
<br />

The [Cloudinary base](https://github.com/cloudinary/cloudinary-js-base) project enables you to create 
Cloudinary URLs for your images and apply advanced transformations on them. 
<br />

To render these URLs you can use one of our frontend SDKs. We currently support [React](https://cloudinary.github.io/frontend-frameworks/public/docs/ReactSDK.html)
and [Angular](https://cloudinary.github.io/frontend-frameworks/public/docs/AngularSDK.html).
On top of displaying your images, our library includes advanced functionality that adds additional features
and capabilities. 
                                                 

To add this extra functionality, you can import one or all of the following plugins:

- [accessibility](https://cloudinary.github.io/frontend-frameworks/public/docs/accessibility.html)
- [lazyload](https://cloudinary.github.io/frontend-frameworks/public/docs/lazyload.html)
- [placeholder](https://cloudinary.github.io/frontend-frameworks/public/docs/placeholder.html)
- [responsive](https://cloudinary.github.io/frontend-frameworks/public/docs/responsive.html)

To learn more about our plugins, navigate to the plugins tab.

## Installation
To get started, install the npm client package of your choice along with our [base package](https://github.com/cloudinary/cloudinary-js-base).
For example, to use Cloudinary in a [React](https://cloudinary.github.io/frontend-frameworks/public/docs/ReactSDK.html) environment, the following packages should be installed:
   
```bash
npm install @cloudinary/base 
npm install @cloudinary/react
```

**Note**: To use [Angular](https://cloudinary.github.io/frontend-frameworks/public/docs/AngularSDK.html) install `@cloudinary/angular` 

For more information on our supported frameworks, navigate to the frameworks tab.

## Simple usage
To following is a simple example using [React](https://cloudinary.github.io/frontend-frameworks/public/docs/ReactSDK.html).
For more information on React and other frameworks, navigate to the frameworks tab. 
```tsx
// Import the cloudinary class, and the plugins you want to use
// In this case, we import a Cloudinary image type and accessibility and responsive.

import React, { Component } from 'react'
import {CloudinaryImage} from "@cloudinary/base/assets/CloudinaryImage";
import { CldImg, accessibility, responsive } from '@cloudinary/react';

 const App = () => {
    let img = new CloudinaryImage('sample', { cloudName: 'demo'});
    return (
        <div>
            <CldImg transformation={img} plugins={[responsive(), accessibility()]}/>
        </div>
    )
  };
```

## Plugin Order

<div>
We recommended the following order when using our plugins to achieve the best results. 
<br/><br/>

```tsx
<CldImg plugins={[lazyload(),responsive(), accessibility(), placeholder()]}/>
```

You can omit any plugin, but the order from above should 
remain to ensure the best possible results.
